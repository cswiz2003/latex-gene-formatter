But at the Potsdam Conference in July-August 1945, at which the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union negotiated the map of Europe and their various domains of control. The border was eventually settled to the west and Zary was designated as part of Poland. The German residents were expelled and the town was repopulated by Poles in the years that followed.

Obituary: "An Old Settler Dies at Balltown: Flavian De Mars, a Nonogenarian and Well Known Citizen Laid to Rest" Mr. Flavian De Mars died last Saturday morning at 7:30 o'clock at the residence of his son-in-law, Mr. W. Fitzpatrick, at Balltown, Jefferson township. Death was due to the infirmities of old age. The remains were brought to this city [Dubuque] and taken to the establishment of Undertaker Walton from which the funeral took place at 9 o'clock this morning, under the auspices of Harmony Lodge, I. Q. O. F., No. 2, and who also conducted the services and furnished the pall bearers. The internment was in Linwood, where services were also held. Mr. De Mars was born in Montreal, Can., in August 1810, and was almost 93 years of age at the time of his demise. Leaving Montreal, he came direct to Dubuque fifty-five years ago [1848], and continued as a resident of this city until about four years ago, when he decided to spend the remainder of his days with his daughter at Balltown. Mr. De Mars was a millwright, and accounted one of the best in the northwest. He set up all of the machinery in the Pelan & Randall saw mill, the Dubuque Lumber company's mill, the Standard Lumber company's mill, the old Jaeger distillery, and he also put in the machinery in many mills throughout the northwest. Mr. De Mars was a well informed man and had a good reputation. He was warm-hearted and genial and always a true friend. His friendship was not a sham. It was of that kind which demonstrated itself in the hour of adversity and he never turned a deaf ear to the wail of distress. He was a man whose integrity was never doubted and whose was never smirched during his long and noble life. In the fullness of years, he has been called to enjoy the reward of a well spent life. He is survived by three daughters and two sons, Mrs. John Ellis of Holy Cross, Mrs. Margaret De Lisle of Dubuque, Mrs. Holder of Waterloo, Gus of Dubuque and Sol of Winona, Minn.; also by a brother in New York and a sister in Montreal.}

General Notes: He and his son, George, faced trial on Apr 7, 1835, with the charges of assault of a "peace officer." He was acquitted, but George was sentenced to 3 months in prison. This may have played a role in the family leaving Cornwall. He emigrated to the United States and settled in what was then, Wisconsin Territory. Joseph and his family appear there in the 1840 census with a household that included: 1 male under age 5, 1 male age 15-19, 1 male age 20-29, 1 male age 50-59, 1 female age 20-29, and 1 female age 50-59. Three people, including Joseph, were employed as miners. [Wisconsin Tribune, Nov 10, 1848]: He was murdered in Mineral Point, WI, July 13, 1847, in the grocery of William Terrell. According to an eye witness who testified in court, he overheard a conversation between Lean and the assailant David J. Odell: Odell: You are a damned imposter and a thief! Lean: How can you prove that? Odell: I have a mind to cut your damn guts out. Lean: Cut away and be damned! "The witness said he next heard the rocks and gravel rattle as Odell made a plunge with the knife, and Lean cried, 'O murder!' He was well acquainted with both and knew their voices; got up immediately and went to the window; saw Lean going toward's Terrell's grocery and Odell towards Col. Nichol's bar room door; witness went down immediately, went out the bar room door, and went over to Terrell's grocery; saw a man holding Lean, and Samuel Terrell holding a wound in Lean's thigh." Joseph was thus killed when his femoral artery was cut in two by a large knife. Odell was sentenced to six years confinement and hard labor in the State Prison for manslaughter for the crime. Gov. Dewey (of Wisconsin) pardoned Odell of the crime in late 1850 [Wisconsin Tribune, Nov 24, 1848; Potosi Republican, Dec 14, 1848; The Telegraph- Courier, Kenosha, Dec 27, 1850]. in Camborne, Cornwall, England.}
